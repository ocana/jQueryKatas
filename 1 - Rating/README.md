## Microsoft: DEV208x Introduction to jQuery

### Module 1 - Lab 1

For module one, you will create the initial interface for your review widget. The interface must meet the following goals:

* Provide five circles for the user to select or click on.
* When the user hovers their mouse over a circle, that circle and all circles to the left must be filled with a color, such as yellow.

There is introductory text on the top, and then 5 circles below. The mouse is over the third circle. The third circle, as well as the two to the left, are displayed with a yellow highlight. The two circles to the right of the mouse are not highlighted.

* When the user clicks on a circle, that circle and all circles to the left must be filled with a different color, such as green. The color must remain, even after the user moves their mouse away from the widget. You do not need to remember the number for page refreshes. You can see a sample of this below.

The clicked state of the desired lab result: The mouse is below the third circle, which is the one that has been clicked on. The third circle, as well as the two to the left of it, are highlighted as green. The two circles to the right are not highlighted. The mouse has been moved away from the circles, but the green highlight remains.

* HTML and CSS for the interface has been provided for your use. The lab can be solved without using any additional HTML; you only need to provide the necessary jQuery.
